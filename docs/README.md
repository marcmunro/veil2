# Veil2
#### A Postgres Add-on For Implementing Relational Security Systems

Veil2 provides a framwork for the implementation of
[relational security
systems](https://marcmunro.github.io/veil2/html/ch01.html).

The primary aims of a relational security system are to make the
management of access to data a seamless, and necessary, component of
your application, and to make its implementation as simple as possible
and as sophisticated as needed.

Veil2 is designed to make the implementation of relational security
systems as easy as possible.  It provides an extensible framework of
permissions, permission checks, and user authentication so that you
can start building a secure database in a matter of hours.

Documentation is [provided
here on github](https://marcmunro.github.io/veil2/html/index.html).

## Getting Started

The concept of a Relational Security System is relatively new and
little-known.  [This
section](https://marcmunro.github.io/veil2/html/ch01.html) describes
what a relational security system is.
[This](https://marcmunro.github.io/veil2/html/ch02.html) describes
what is different about relational security, and the fundamental
concepts behind Veil2 are [described here](https://marcmunro.github.io/veil2/html/ch04.html).
