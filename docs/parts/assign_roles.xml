  <title>Assign Initial Roles</title>
  <para>
    Finally, we assign some initial roles to users.  See STEP 11 in
    file <literal>demo/demo.sql</literal>.

    <title>Roles</title>
    <para>
      Firtly you will need to give the <literal>connect</literal> role
      to all of your users.  This role allows them to authenticate.
      Without it, they will be unable to access any data.
    </para>
    <para>
      After this, you will assign user-level roles to your users based
      on need.  For testing and development you will also need to
      assign superuser roles so that you have <quote>control</quote>
      users whose access is not restricted.  If you find something
      that is not working as you expect, try it using one of these
      control users.  If it works for them, then you have an access
      control problem.  If not, the bug lies elsewhere.
