    <title>Email</title>
    <para>
      Marc is not going to publish his email address here as he gets
      enough spam as it is.  But he isn't that hard to find with a bit
      of googling.  Put Veil2 in the email subject line and you're
      less likly to fall into the spam bucket.  If all else fails,
      raise an issue and he'll probably get back to you.
