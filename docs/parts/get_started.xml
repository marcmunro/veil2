	  extensions in your database.  For
	  <literal>pgbitmap</literal>, this means that you will
	  probably need a full build environment unless you can find
	  someone you trust who has a pre-built library you can use.
	  See the <ulink

	<title>Operating System Environment</title>
	<para>
	  You should be able to install <literal>Veil2</literal> on
	  any operating system, though something Unix-like is
	  recommended, as we use <literal>make</literal> for a lot of
	  tasks.  If you don't have <literal>make</literal> available,
	  you can still install <literal>Veil2</literal> but you will
	  be doing it directly from the SQL scripts.

	<title>Software Required</title>
	<para>
	  If you want to install from git and build the documentation
	  from source, you will need the following:

	    <listitem><literal>xsltproc;</literal></listitem>
	    <listitem><literal>libxslt1.1;</literal></listitem>
	    <listitem><literal>libxml2;</literal></listitem>

	    <listitem><literal>make;</literal></listitem>
	    <listitem>docbook 4.5 stylesheets.</listitem>

	  <literal>docbook-xsl</literal> and

	  For installation from tarballs, you will only need a

	You may install either from pre-built tarballs, or directly

	Before running any of the <literal>Veil2</literal> SQL
	scripts, you should satisfy yourself that they will do no harm
	to any of your existing databases.  Obviously you will not run
	them in your production environment.  The scripts are mostly
	safe but they do create and drop users and roles.  These are
	all named <literal>veil_&lt;something&gt;</literal> so they
	should not conflict with anything you are already using BUT
	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you'd like to test the <literal>Veil2</literal>
	installation, you should run the command:
	<programlisting>
$ make unit TESTDB=whateverdbnameyoulike
	</programlisting>
	The name you give <literal>TESTDB</literal> is the name of the
	database that will be created for testing.  This should
	<emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> be the name of an
	existing database!  If you don't provide
	<literal>TESTDB</literal>, the database name will be
	<literal>vpd</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If all is well, you'll see something like this:

	If you see any mention of ERROR, then your installation has a
	problem.  This will either mean that your extensions are not
	properly installed, or that you have found a bug.  Start by
	carefully reading the output and see if you can figure it out
	for yourself.  If not, see reporting bugs TODO.

    <title>Installing The Demo</title>
    <para>
      We start by creating a database and installing the 
      <literal>Veil2</literal> database objects.  We can do this using
      <literal>make</literal>:
      	<programlisting>
$ make db TESTDB=whateverdbnameyoulike
	</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Next, we run the demo creation script against the newly created
      database:
      	<programlisting>
$ psql -d whateverdbnameyoulike -f demo/demo.sql
	</programlisting>
      This installs the demo database, and links it to the
      <literal>Veil2</literal> database objects.  The demo database is
      now ready to use.
