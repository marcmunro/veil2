  <para>
    The only essential housekeeping task beyond normal database
    maintenance is to add a periodic job to delete expired sessions.
    This can be done by simply calling the <literal><link
    linkend="func_delete_expired_sessions">delete_expired_sessions()</link></literal>
    function.  This needs to be called often enough that the <link
    linkend="entity_session"><literal>veil2.sessions</literal></link>
    table does not become bloated.  How often will depend on the
    amount of traffic to your database.
