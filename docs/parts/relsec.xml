  <title>What Is A Relational Security System?</title>
  <para>
    A Relational Security System is one in which each assigned
    privilege has a relational scope, which limits the extent to
    which the privilege applies.
  </para>
  <para>
    The scope of an assigned privilege is related to a specific subset
    of data, so that each privilege assignment will give access to
    that specific subset.  The scope may be all-encompassing or very
    specific.  It may give access to thousands of records; to just a
    few; or even to none.  And privileges may be assigned multiple
    times, in different scopes.
  </para>
  <para>
    Scopes may be created from almost any definable subset of your
    data.  Mostly they are based on the relationships of your users
    with their data, though they need not be.  Typically, scopes are
    defined in terms of parties and their relationships either to
    other parties, or to specific artefacts described by your
    database.  For example, a person's relationship to the company
    they work for, or their membership of a project team.
  </para>
  <para>
    Having scopes associated with privileges means that the
    granularity of access controls can be as coarse or as fine as the
    data demands, and it means that there is rarely the need for more
    complex access checks than "do I have privilege X in scope Y?".
  </para>
  <para>
    Instead of having privileges which imply conditional rule checks,
    such as the privilege to <emphasis>maintain a project if the user
    is a member of the project team</emphasis>, privileges can
    effectively contain their conditionality through their scope.
