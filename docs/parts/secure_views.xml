  <title>Secure Your Views (STEP 10)</title>
  <para>
    Just as with tables, user-facing views should be secured.  You can
    do this either explicitly, by adding privilege testing functions to
    the view definitions, or implicitly by building the views on
    tables that have already been secured.  In this latter case, the
    views will need to be owned by a separate database role from that
    which owns the tables as views are processed with the access
    rights of their owners.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is best explained by example.  Here is an example from the
    demo:
    <programlisting>
create or replace
view party_roles (
    party_id,
    role_name,
    context_type,
    corp_context_id,
    org_context_id) as
select ar.accessor_id, r.role_name,
       st.scope_type_name,
       case when ar.context_type_id = 3
       then ar.context_id
       else null
       end,
       case when ar.context_type_id = 4
       then ar.context_id
       else null
       end 
  from veil2.accessor_roles ar
 inner join veil2.roles r
         on r.role_id = ar.role_id
 inner join veil2.scope_types st
         on st.scope_type_id = ar.context_type_id
 where veil2.i_have_global_priv(20)
    or veil2.i_have_priv_in_scope(20, 3, context_id)
    or veil2.i_have_priv_in_scope(20, 4, context_id);
    </programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that if the view is updatable you will also need to build
    instead-of triggers or some equivalent, that take into account
    update, insert and delete privileges.  One wrinkle with updatable
    views is that they should not allow modifications of rows that
    they would not be allowed to see, so the select privilege must
    usually be explicitly tested in addition to the select, insert or
    update privilege.
  </para>
  <para>
    Views do provide some interesting possibilities though.  One is to
    use the privilege testing functions on specific columns to make
    access controls even more fine-grained.
