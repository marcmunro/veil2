  <para>
    For many <literal>Veil2</literal>-protected database, there will
    be no oddities or corner-cases, for some though all of the
    customizations done up til now will still not be enough to give
    you the functionality you need.

    If this is the situation you face, and you need even more

    time to do it.

  <para>
    In this step you will alter and extend <literal>Veil2</literal>
    functionality by redefining built-in <link
    linkend="custom-functions">functions</link> and <link
    linkend="custom-views">views</link>.  Note that doing so comes
    with a certain amount of maintenance overhead.  If you upgrade the
    <literal>Veil2</literal> extension you will need to ensure that
    your redefined functions and views continue to play nicely with
    the rest of <literal>Veil2</literal>, and that they incorporate
    any changes or bugfixes that may be appropriate if and when the
    extension is upgraded.
