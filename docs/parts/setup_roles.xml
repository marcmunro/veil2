  <title>Integrate And/Or Create Roles (STEP 8)</title>
  <para>
    The demo chooses to use only <literal>Veil2</literal>'s role
    tables for its roles implementation.  This makes things very
    simple, but may be unhelpful as an example.  The author apologises
    but there are some things you will have to do for yourselves.
    Look for  STEP 8 in the file
    <literal>demo/veil2_demo--&version;.sql</literal>.

    <title>Integrating Existing Roles</title>
    <para>
      If your existing system has roles of some sort that you wish to
      keep using, you are going to have to find a way to integrate
      them with the <literal>veil2.roles</literal> table.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are essentially three options:
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Link <literal>Veil2</literal> To Your Existing Data</title> 
      <para>
	This is likely to be a reasonably complex process.  You are
	going to need:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      an id mapping mechanism;
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Your existing role keys are not going to work with
	      <literal>Veil2</literal>, so we will need a way to map
	      your role keys with <literal>Veil2</literal>'s
	      <literal>role_ids</literal>.  Note that you need to keep
	      the range of <literal>role_id</literal>s as small as
	      possible in order to keep their bitmap representations
	      small.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      You will need to create a table that maps between 
	      <literal>veil2.roles</literal> and your database's roles
	      table(s).  Use foreign key relationships and triggers to
	      ensure that your mapping table is kept in step with your
	      existing table and the <literal>veil2.roles</literal>
	      table. 
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For some examples of how the triggers can be constructed
	      take a look at the demo.  In particular the way that the
	      demo's <literal>parties</literal> table is linked to
	      <literal>veil2.accessors</literal>. 
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	Whether this will work, will depend on the semantics of your
	existing role implementation.  If they are similar to
	<literal>Veil2</literal>'s role semantics, this may work.  You
	will have to do some careful thinking about this.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Make <literal>Veil2</literal>'s Roles Provide Your Role
      Data</title>
      <para>
	In this option, we replace your roles implementation with that
	from <literal>Veil2</literal> but make it look like your
	existing implementation is still in place.
      </para>
      <para>
	The key to this is to use views and instead-of triggers to
	make the <literal>Veil2</literal> table function in the same
	way as your existing table.
      </para>
      <para>
	As with the previous option, this will require some serious
	thinking, but it will probably give you a simpler system than
	the previous option.  Roles and privileges are complex enough
	without adding an extra level of redirection.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Update Your Application To Use <literal>Veil2</literal>'s Roles</title>
      <para>
	This is conceptually the simplest approach but the amount of
	work will very much depend on your existing system and its
	needs.
      </para>
      <para>
	The demo chooses to use <literal>Veil2</literal>'s
	implementation of roles, rather than integrating any existing
	role implementation.  Since the demo was built with
	<literal>Veil2</literal> in mind this makes a lot of sense as
	it keeps the implementation much cleaner and simpler.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you are building a new system from scratch, this should be
	your prefered approach.
      </para>

    <title>Create New Roles and Mappings</title>
    <para>
      If your application has user-level roles (roles that are
      assigned to users), you may be able to re-use them.  You will
      probably not have function-level roles however, and you will
      need to at least create a minimal set of these.
    </para>
    <para>
      The minimal set of user-level roles should be enough to give you
      2 or more pieces of functionality that you can then use to test
      your access control mechanisms.  To these roles, you will
      assign privileges by creating records in
      <literal>veil2.role_privileges</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      You will then need to create role to role mappings, making your
      function-level roles available to your user-level roles.  You
      will do this by creating records in
      <literal>veil2.role_roles</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      As with privileges, you should keep the range of
      <literal>role_ids</literal> as small as possible, allocating them
      contiguously and re-use ids for records that get deleted.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that if you have decided to use 

      defined that role to role mappings are done
      in anything other than the global context (as described <link
      linkend="role_mapping_context">here</link>) your role to role
      mappings may need to be repeated for each context.  Your role
      names may also need to be customized for those contexts.  This
      is shown in the demo; look for the text STEP 8.
    </para>

    <title>Refreshing Materialized Views - Do Nothing</title>
    <para>
      Any time that role to role or role to privilege mappings are
      updated, all <link linkend="cache">materialized views and
      caches</link> must be updated. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Since these mappings are managed exclusively from
      <literal>Veil2</literal> tables, all the necessary triggers to
      refresh our materialized views are already in place.
    </para>
