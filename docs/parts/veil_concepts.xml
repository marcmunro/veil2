    The following concepts are crucial to a full understanding of

    This looks like a lot to understand, but you don't need to grasp
    it all at once.  Once you fully understand <link
    linkend="privileges">privileges</link> and <link
    linkend="scopes">scopes</link>, the rest can be dealt with as the
    need arises.  Few applications will need all of the features
    provided by <literal>Veil2</literal>, and you can probably ignore
    the stuff you don't think you need.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="privileges">
    <title>Privileges</title>
    <para>
      Privileges are the atomic units of access control, limiting
      access to specific data or operations.  By convention, most
      privileges are named <quote><literal>&lt;action&gt;
      &lt;object&gt;</literal></quote>.  Actions will include:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>select;</listitem>
	<listitem>insert;</listitem>
	<listitem>update;</listitem>
	<listitem>delete;</listitem>
	<listitem>execute.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Objects will usually be the names of tables and, for
      <literal>execute</literal> actions, the names of specific pieces
      of functionality.  Note that <literal>Veil2</literal> takes no
      notice of privilege names, using only the
      <literal>privilege_id</literal>.  It is up to the implementation
      to ensure that each privilege is used in a manner consistent
      with its name.
    </para>
    <para>
      Privileges are not assigned directly to users.  Instead they are
      assigned through <link linkend="roles">roles</link> which are
      essentially collections of privileges.
    </para>
    <para>
      A typical privilege might be <literal>select parties</literal>
      which we could assume would allow select access to the
      <literal>parties</literal> table.  Note that every privilege
      in <literal>Veil2</literal> applies in a specific
      <link linkend="scopes">scope</link>, which is based on the <link
      linkend="security-contexts">context</link> of the <link
      linkend="assignments">role assignment</link> of the <link
      linkend="roles">role</link> providing that privilege.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <literal>Veil2</literal>-based security system is likely to
      have tens or hundreds of distinct privileges.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="security-contexts">
    <title>Security Contexts</title>
    <para>
      A security context (or more usually just
      <literal>context</literal>) is the user-facing equivalent to a
      <link linkend="scopes">scope</link>.  Where scopes apply
      at the level of individual privileges, contexts apply to the user
      and the user experience.  Specifically, we talk about contexts
      as they apply to:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    role assignments;
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Each role that is assigned to a user, whether implicitly
	    or explicitly, is assigned within a given context.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    authentication;
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Different users of a <literal>Veil2</literal>-based system
	    may authenticate using different web pages or apps.  There
	    may be completely distinct sets of users in the context of
	    different corporate clients, with usernames only having to
	    be unique within the context of each corporation.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem id="mapping-context">
	  <para>
	    mapping;
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    As described in <link linkend="role_mapping">contextual
	    role mapping</link>, your role to role mappings may be
	    different for different users.  The context that is used
	    for a given session's role mappings is known as the
	    mapping context.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem id="session-context">
	  <para>
	    sessions;
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It may be that although a user authenticates in the
	    context of a corporation, their session exists within the
	    context of a specific subdivision of that corporation.
	    The access rights for the user will be determined from
	    this session context.  If they are allowed to create
	    sessions in multiple contexts, their access rights may be
	    different in each one.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      In <literal>Veil2</literal> there is a scope for every context,
      and vice versa.
    </para>
    <para>
      The distinction between scope and context may become clear
      when we consider that a role can be assigned in a context that
      has no meaning for that role's privileges.  Consider a
      <literal>team-member</literal> role assigned in the context of a
      specific project that contains the <literal>select
      lookups</literal> privilege.  This privilege allows the accessor
      select-access to lookup data which is not project-specific.
      This privilege must operate in a different scope from the
      context of its assignment, and so its operating scope will need
      to be promoted (see <link
      linkend="scope-promotion">scope promotion</link> below).
    </para>
    <para>
      It is largely because privileges may apply in different scopes
      from their role's assignment context, that contexts and scopes
      have distinct terms.  While this may seem to be semantic
      pedantry, the opportunities for confusion when discussing scopes
      and contexts are such that the distinction is useful.  The
      author has been there and resents that he will never get those
      hours back.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>Veil2</literal> provides 2 built-in security 
      contexts:
    </para>
    <sect2 id="global-context">
      <title>Global Context</title>
      <para>
	This is a non-relational context.  Privileges assigned in
	global context apply without limitation.  If you are assigned
	a role in global context, all of its privileges will apply in
	global scope.  If you have been assigned the <literal>select
	customer</literal> privilege (via a role) in global context, 
        you will be able to see all <literal>customer</literal>
	records.
      </para>
      <para>
        Global Context is powerful and dangerous. It is the level of
        access control provided by <link
        linkend="Traditional">traditional</link> security systems and
        it should be used with great care.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="personal-context">
      <title>Personal Context</title>
      <para>
	Personal context is an implied context.  Each user has an
	implicit assignment of the <literal>personal context</literal>
	role in this context.
      </para>
      <para>
        The personal context is all about the application user, ie the
        person that is using your application. It applies to data that
        is about that person.  This would include their authentication
        credentials, contact information, etc. The purpose of the
        personal context is to give users access to their own data,
        and no-one else’s.  Each user has their own personal context.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="scopes">
    <title>Scopes</title>
    <para>
      A scope describes the applicability of a <link
      linkend="privileges">privilege</link>.  Scopes are mostly based
      upon existing relationships in your data.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that for every scope, there is an equivalent <link
      linkend="security-contexts">security context</link>.  Where
      contexts are user facing and are applied to the assignment of
      <link linkend="roles">roles</link>, scopes apply at the level of
      individual privileges and are more of an implementation detail.
    </para>
    <para>
      A scope may apply to an organization, a department, a project,
      or whatever you wish.  Having a privilege in the scope of one
      department would presumably give you access rights to data for
      that department.  It would not give you access to equivalent
      data for other departments.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some scopes will allow access to large subsets of data, and some
      to very small subsets.  We refer to this as the scope level.  A
      scope that is very restrictive is considered a low-level scope,
      and one that is not, is a high-level scope.  When we talk about
      <link linkend="scope-promotion">scope promotion</link>,
      this is always from a lower level to a higher level, which is to
      say that the scope becomes less restrictive, and likely to
      return a larger set of data.
    </para>
    <para>
      One scope that is particularly low-level is personal scope.
      This limits access to data that specifically relates to the
      accessor (privilege holder).  So if <literal>user X</literal>
      has the <literal>select user</literal> privilege in personal
      scope, they will be able to see their own
      <literal>users</literal> record.  Whether they can see other
      <literal>users</literal> records will depend on whether they
      have the <literal>select users</literal> privilege in any other
      scopes.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="roles">
    <title>Roles</title>
    <para>
      Roles exist to manage collections of <link
      linkend="privileges">privileges</link>.  Because privileges
      apply at such a low level, managing access by assigning
      individual privileges is untenable.  Instead we manage groups of
      privileges through roles.  Privileges are assigned to roles, and
      roles are assigned to users.  See <link
      linkend="assignments">role assignments</link>; <link
      linkend="security-contexts">security contexts</link>; and <link
      linkend="scope-promotion">scope promotion</link>, for
      information on how each privilege's <link
      linkend="scopes">scope</link> is managed.
    </para>
    <para>
      To make roles more flexible, we allow roles to be assigned to
      other roles.  We call this role-mapping.  This allows us to
      create low-level <emphasis>functional</emphasis> roles that have
      the privileges necessary to perform a specific low-level task,
      and we assign these roles to higher-level
      <emphasis>user</emphasis> roles which can then be assigned to
      users.  By doing this, we minimize the number of different roles
      that we need to be able to assign to users.
    </para>
    <para>
      Typical functional roles might include: <literal>view
      order</literal>, <literal>create order</literal>,
      <literal>approve order</literal>, etc.  These function level
      roles might then be assigned to user roles such as
      <literal>customer service rep</literal>, <literal>customer
      service manager</literal>, <literal>product manager</literal>,
      etc.  Typically you would only assign user level roles to users.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the roles themselves do not care whether they are functional
      or user level, there is no limit to how deeply role to role
      mappings may be nested.  This can be useful when you want to
      create a user-level role that combines the abilities of 2 or
      more existing user-level roles.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>Veil2</literal> does not care how roles are mapped to
      each other, in fact, you can map <literal>Role A</literal> to
      <literal>Role B</literal> and then <literal>Role B</literal> to
      <literal>Role A</literal>, and <literal>Veil2</literal> will
      handle it just fine; it will just mean that the two roles are
      equivalent - which is hardly useful.  You may want to implement
      some policies around this for your own system.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="role_mapping">
      <title>Contextual Role Mapping</title>
      <para>
	One of the possible use-cases for <literal>Veil2</literal> is
	to provide <ulink
	url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_database">Virtual
	Private Databases</ulink> in a <ulink
	url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</ulink>
	environment.  As such, it is possible that different clients
	of such a service might want different user-level roles, and
	different mappings between them and the base function-level
	roles.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you don't need this, you can skip ahead.  Although
	<literal>Veil2</literal> provides this as a feature, you don't
	have to use it and it is not enabled by default.
      </para>
      <para>
	In <literal>Veil2</literal>, each role to role mapping is done
	within a specific <literal>mapping context</literal>.  The
	default <literal>mapping context</literal> is global, which
	means that that role mapping applies to all users.  By
	changing this value we can make role mappings apply at
	different context levels.  Typically, we would set this to
	operate at the context of a specific SaaS client, so that
	users for each client would be able to define their own roles
	and role to role mappings.

  <sect1 id="assignments">
    <title>Role Assignments</title>
    <para>
      Users are assigned <link linkend="roles">roles</link> in a
      number of ways, and <literal>Veil2</literal> places no limits on
      the mechanisms that an implementation may choose to use.
      Assignments may be explicit, implicit or even a combination of
      the two.
    </para>
    <para>
      An explicit role assignment would consist of a record
      associating a role with the user being assigned the role, in a
      specific context (see security contexts below).  This record
      would be for the sole purpose of assigning the role.  This is
      what makes it explicit.
    </para>
    <para>
      Implicit role assignments can be made in a number of ways.  In
      <literal>Veil2</literal> each user, by default, is assigned the
      <link linkend="personal_context_role"><literal>personal
      context</literal></link> role, in their own personal context
      <link linkend="personal-context">as described below</link>.
      This is done by <literal>Veil2</literal> itself, and is not the
      result of any record relating the role to the user.  Note that
      although the role is assigned by default, it has no <link
      linkend="privileges">privileges</link>.  What <literal>personal
      context</literal> allows is up to your implementation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Other forms of implicit role assignment will be through existing
      data relationships.  For instance, we might want project team
      members to have certain privileges to the data for their
      projects.  This would be done through their assignment to the
      project as a team member.  It is possible that such a membership
      record would have an explicit role associated with it, but it is
      equally possible that <quote>membership</quote> is implied
      simply by the existence of a <literal>team_member</literal>
      record linking the user and the project.  In such a case we
      would create a <literal>team member</literal> role, and the
      assignment of this role to team members would be implicit.

  <sect1 id="scope-promotion">
    <title>Scope (and Context) Promotion</title>
    <para>
      Sometimes the context of a role assignment or a session is not
      entirely appropriate for all of its purposes.  In these cases,
      promotion is necessary.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are 2 distinct situations where promotion occurs:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  promotion of scope for privileges;
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  promotion of session context for mapping context.

    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Promotion Of Scope For Privileges</title>
      <para>
	<link linkend="privileges">Privileges</link> may give access
	to rows in a table, or to specific functionality. Often, a
	privilege that is needed for a particular <link
	linkend="roles">role</link>, will apply to an object that
	exists outside of the <link
	linkend="security-contexts">context</link> of the <link
	linkend="assignments">role assignment</link>.  In such cases,
	the privilege must be promoted from the context of its
	assignment to apply in a higher-level <link
	linkend="scopes">scope</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Consider a <link linkend="roles">role</link>,
	<literal>CSR</literal>, that has been assigned to a user in
	<literal>customer context</literal> for <literal>customer
	Z</literal>.  This hypothetical role assignment is supposed to
	give the user the ability to manage <literal>customer
	Z</literal> and no other customer.  Among the hypothetical
	privileges for this role are:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	<listitem><literal>select customer</literal>;</listitem>
	<listitem><literal>update customer</literal>; </listitem>
	<listitem><literal>...</literal>;</listitem>
	<listitem><literal>select lookups</literal>.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	If we assume that <literal>select lookups</literal> gives the
	user the ability to view all lookup data, we can see that it
	doesn’t really apply to the <literal>customer
	context</literal>.  It is not related to customer-specific
	data.  In fact it should apply the same regardless of who we
	might be a <literal>CSR</literal> for.  This privilege should
	be applied in the global scope, but it has been assigned in
	the <literal>customer context</literal> for <literal>customer
	Z</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
	The context for the role assignment makes no sense for this
	privilege, so it must be promoted to a higher-level scope.  In
	this case, the scope would be that of the <literal>global
	context</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
	As another example consider that a role that has been assigned
	in <literal>project context</literal> provides the
	<literal>select department</literal> privilege to view the
	department details of the department that owns the project.
	The department details cannot be viewed in project scope,
	because projects are lower-level things: the department owns
	the project and not the other way around.  The solution is to
	promote the <literal>select department</literal> privilege to
	operate in department scope.  Note that if the <literal>select
	project</literal> privilege were promoted in the same way, it
	would allow the user to view all projects for the department.
      </para>
      <para>
	The level of promotion required for each privilege is specific
	to the object that the privilege exists to protect.  So, each
	privilege identifies its target scope level.  If the privilege
	is being assigned, via a role assignment, in a lower-level
	context, then promotion to the higher target scope level will
	automatically be performed when the user's privileges are
	first loaded.

      <para>
	The <link linkend="mapping-context">mapping context</link>

      <para>
	If the session context is not at the scope level of our target

  <sect1 id="authentication_context">
    <title>Authentication Contexts</title>
    <para>
      Each accessor (database user) is associated with a specific
      context within which they authenticate.  Typically, this context
      would represent the organization they work for.  When
      authenticating an accessor, their authentication context must be
      provided along with their username or other identifier.
    </para>
    <para>
      What this means is that usernames, etc do not have to be
      globally unique, but only unique within each authentication
      context.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you don't need this, you can choose to allow all accessors to
      authenticate within the same context, usually the global context.
    </para>
    <para>
      As described in <link linkend="role_mapping">Contextual Role
      Mapping</link> above, the role names and role to role mappings
      that an accessor sees may depend on their authentication context.
    </para>
    <para>
      More information on this, with examples, can be found <link
      linkend="physical_authentication_context">here</link>.

  <sect1 id="session_context">
    <title>Session Contexts</title>
    <para>
      When a user authenticates, they begin a session, and this session
      has a context.  The session context determines what data the
      user can see, as though the user is logged in to that context.
      Often the session context will be the same as the authentication
      context, but <literal>Veil2</literal> does not require this.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, consider that our authentication context is at the
      level of a corporation (so usernames must be unique within the
      entire corporation), but that we log in to the web-site for a
      subdivision.  Our authentication context would be the
      corporation context, and the session context would be the
      subdivision context.
    </para>
    <para>
      The context of a user's session will determine the access rights
      for that session.  Role assignments in contexts that are
      unrelated to the session context will be ignored.
