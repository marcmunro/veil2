  <title>Exploring The <literal>Veil2</literal> Demos</title>
  <para>
    <literal>Veil2</literal> is supplied with 2 demo applications,
    packaged as extensions. These are:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <literal>veil2_demo</literal>;
	</para>
	<para>
	  This provides an extension that demonstrates multiple types
	  of scopes emulating a Software As A Service implementation
	  for multiple corporate clients.  The demo is workable but
	  incomplete as not all triggers, rules, etc are provided.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <literal>veil2_minimal_demo</literal>;
	</para>
	<para>
	  This aims to be a more complete implementation than
	  <literal>veil2_demo</literal>, but of a much simpler
	  system.  It emulates a social media site that allows users
	  to make postings that are private, public, or for friends
	  only.  Most access controls are based on the friend
	  relationships between users.

    <title>The <literal>veil2_demo</literal> Extension</title>
    <para>
      The <literal>Veil2</literal> demo exists to demonstrate a <link
      linkend="what-is-relational-security">Relational Security
      System</link>, show its capabilities, and provide an example of
      <literal>Veil2</literal> in use.  It is a trivial, simple and
      incomplete example but provides enough of a foundation to
      explore and understand what <literal>Veil2</literal> is capable
      of.
    </para>
    <para>
      You are encouraged to dissect, play with, and hack on, the demo.
      There is much that has not been implemented.  Feel free to
      implement the missing parts.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Installation</title>
      <para>
	The demo can be most easily installed as a package from within
	postgres:
	<programlisting>
vpd=# create extension veil2_demo cascade;
CREATE EXTENSION
vpd=# 
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	As an alternative you can run the <literal>demo.sql</literal>
	script which can be found as described <link
	linkend="next_steps">here</link>, eg
	<programlisting>
marc:veil2$ psql -d vpd -f /usr/share/postgresql/12/veil2/demo.sql
	</programlisting>
	This installs the veil2_demo and runs a simple set of tests on
	it.  Note that in order to run the tests as supplied, the
	postgres user <literal>demouser</literal> must be given access
	as described below
      </para>
      <para>
	As a final option, if you have cloned the
	<literal>Veil2</literal> source from github you can use make:
	<programlisting>
marc:veil2$ make demo
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <sect3 id="demouser-access">
	<title>Allowing Access For The Demo User</title>
	<para>
          The <literal>Veil2</literal> test script
          <literal>demo/demo_test.sql</literal> accesses the test
          database using demo user <literal>demouser</literal>, which
          it assumes is a trusted user (ie no password is needed).
          Note that this is not a good security practice and is done
          simply for simplicity and expediency.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If this doesn't work for you, you can create a modified
	  version of the test script to use a more secure
	  authentication method that conforms with your site's
	  policies and requirements.  However if you want to simply
	  try the demo in a test or development environment where
	  security is not a concern, you can enable trust-based
	  authentication solely for the <literal>demouser</literal>
	  role, solely for your demo database.
	</para>
	<para>
          To allow <literal>demouser</literal> to access the demo
          database without needing to provide authentication you will
          need to add a <quote>trust</quote> authentication definition
          to your <literal>pg_hba.conf</literal> file.  This line
          should look something like this:
          <programlisting>
local   whateverdbnameyoulike demouser                          trust
          </programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
          This defines that local (ie non-networked) connections to
          the <literal>whateverdbnameyoulike</literal> database by the
          <literal>demouser</literal> user are to be trusted.  This
          line must appear <emphasis role="bold">before</emphasis> any
          <literal>local</literal> definition for
          <literal>all</literal> databases or <literal>all</literal>
          users.

      <para>
	The diagram above provides a logical view of the
	<literal>Veil2_demo</literal> database.  The
	<literal>privilege</literal>, <literal>role</literal>,
	<literal>role_privilege</literal> and
	<literal>role_role</literal> entities are from
	<literal>Veil2</literal>, while the rest are created
	specifically for the application.
      </para>
      <para>
	<literal>Parties</literal> may be persons, corporations or
	organizations, where organizations are subdivisions of
	corporations.  Every party belongs to both an organization and
	a corporation.
      </para>
      <para>
	All users are <literal>persons</literal>.  Their access rights
	are determined by their <literal>party_roles</literal>, their
	<literal>project_assignments</literal> and by their (implied)
	<literal>personal_context</literal> role (this relationship is
	shown in the diagram with an asterisk).  These tables and
	relationships provide the <emphasis>entire</emphasis>
	relational security model for the
	<literal>veil2_demo</literal> application.
      </para>
      <para>
	Note that <literal>role_role</literal> has a <literal>mapping
	context</literal> relationship back to
	<literal>corporation</literal>.  This allows each corporation
	to manage its own independent set of <literal>role</literal>
	to <literal>role</literal> mappings.
      </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Security Contexts</title>
      <para>
	The demo provides 3 relational contexts:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>corp context;</listitem>
	  <listitem>org context;</listitem>
	  <listitem>project context</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <sect3>
	<title>Corp Context</title>
	<para>
	  The demo uses the <literal>parties</literal> table to
	  identify organizations and persons.  There is a tree
	  structured organizational hierarchy of organizations.  The
	  top-level of each organizational tree is called a corp, or
	  corporation.  The corp context applies to all data owned by
	  the corp, and by all organizations within it.  Many tables
	  contain a <literal>corp_id</literal> field as a data
	  denormalization to make privilege testing in corp context
	  easier and faster.
	</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
	<title>Org Context</title>
	<para>
	  Within each corp there is a tree of organizational parts, or
	  orgs.  Privileges applied in org contexts apply in all
	  subordinate orgs.  Technically, there is little to
	  distinguish between corp context and a top-level org
	  context, but corp context provides faster privilege checks
	  in this implementation.
	</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
	<title>Project Context</title>
	<para>
	  Projects have their own contexts.  Assignment to a project
	  uses a different mechanism from the more explicit role
	  assignments made in the other contexts.
	</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>The Organizational Hierarchy</title>
      <para>
	See the above descriptions of corp and org contexts for an
	introduction to this.  Persons work for specific orgs in the
	org hierarchy.  The company they work for provides their login
	context.  There are comments in the
	<literal>demo/demo.sql</literal> file that should help it all
	make sense.  Take a look at them.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Exploring It</title>
      <para>
	You can create the demo database by simply creating the
	extension <literal>veil2_demo</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
	The extension creates an unprivileged
	<literal>demouser</literal> (demo user) account, which you
	should use to explore the demo.  Using a privileged account
	will bypass the security which would be pointless and
	uninteresting.
      </para>
      <sect3>
	<title>Users</title>
	<para>
	  This section describes a number of the users defined for the
	  demo.  These users are mostly assigned the same roles, but
	  they each see different subsets of data.  This should be a
	  pretty convincing demonstration of the power of relational
	  security contexts.  Note that although the users are
	  connecting in a number of different login contexts, their
	  <link linkend="role_mapping">role mapping</link> contexts
	  are all the same (the global context).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The code that follows uses a shortcut single query
	  authentication process.  You should probably not do this in
	  real life.  The overhead of an extra database round-trip
	  will, in most cases, be so small that it will not be
	  noticeable, and the ability to subsequently use the two-step
	  authentication protocol as a means to further improve your
	  authentication security is something that you may not want
	  to lose.  For more on this see the <link
	  linkend="authent_protocols">authentication protocols</link>
	  appendix.
	</para>
	<sect4>
	  <title>Alice</title>
	  <para>
	    Alice is a global superuser.  She works for Veil Corp
	    (corp 1000).  She authenticates using bcrypt.  You can
	    connect as Alice using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Alice', 'bcrypt', 4, 1000) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd1');
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Because she has global superuser privilege, Alice can see
	    all records.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To see which privileges she has, and how she has arrived
	    at them, run the following query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.privilege_assignments
vpd-# where accessor_id = 1080;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	</sect4>
	<sect4>
	  <title>Bob</title>
	  <para>
	    Bob is a superuser in corp context for Secured Corp.  He
	    works for Secured Corp (corp 1010).  He authenticates
	    using plaintext.  You can connect as Bob using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Bob', 'plaintext', 4, 1010) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd2') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Because he has superuser privilege for Secured Corp, Bob
	    can see all records associated with Secured Corp.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you compare Bob's
	    <literal>privilege_assignments</literal> with Alice's, you
	    will see that Bob has all of the same privileges that
	    Alice has, but assigned in different contexts.  This is
	    why Bob sees fewer records than Alice.
	  </para>
	</sect4>
	<sect4>
	  <title>Carol</title>
	  <para>
	    Carol is a superuser in corp context for Protected Corp.
	    She works for Protected Corp (corp 1020).  She
	    authenticates using plaintext.  You can connect as Carol
	    using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Carol', 'plaintext', 4, 1020) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd3') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Unlike Bob, Carol can see no projects.  This is because
	    Protected Corp has no projects.
	  </para>
	</sect4>
	<sect4>
	  <title>Eve</title>
	  <para>
	    Eve is a superuser in corp context for both Secure Corp
	    and Protected Corp.  She works for Veil Corp (corp 1000).
	    She authenticates using plaintext.  She has the <link
	    linkend="connect_role"><literal>connect</literal></link>
	    role for Veil Corp and Secured Corp.  This means she
	    authenticates within Veil Corp but also has the right to
	    connect to Secured Corp.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    You can connect as Eve in Veil Corp using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Eve', 'plaintext', 4, 1000) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd4') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Connected to Veil Corp, Eve can only see her own party
	    record.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To connect Eve in the context of Secured Corp you cab do
	    this:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Eve', 'plaintext', 4, 1000, 4, 1010) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd4') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Eve now sees all parties in corp 1010 (plus herself).  She
	    sees all projects and project assignments within corp
	    1010.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Eve cannot log in to Protected Corp, even though she has
	    the <literal>superuser</literal> role because she has not
	    been given the <literal>connect</literal> role in that
	    context.  If you wish, you can verify this using:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Eve', 'plaintext', 4, 1000, 4, 1020) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd4') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	    If you give Eve the <literal>connect</literal> role for
	    Protected Corp she will then be able to log in and see all
	    parties for Protected Corp:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Eve', 'plaintext', 4, 1000, 4, 1020) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd4') o1;

	    What this shows is that Eve can see all users in both
	    corps, but only for one corp at a time, depending on how
	    she has logged in.  Pretty cool, eh?
	  </para>
	</sect4>
	<sect4>
	  <title>Sue</title>
	  <para>
	    Sue is a superuser in org context for Department S.  She
	    works for Department S (org 1050).  She authenticates
	    using plaintext.  You can connect as Sue using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
  from veil2.create_session('Sue', 'plaintext', 4, 1050) c
 cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd5') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Sue sees only those party, party_assignment and project
	    records for Department S.  Of particular interest are the
	    <literal>project_assignment</literal> records for which
	    Sue gets the appropriate privilege in a scope superior to
	    the context of the project itself.  Try executing these 2
	    queries:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select veil2.i_have_priv_in_scope(26, 5, 1);
vpd=# select veil2.i_have_priv_in_superior_scope(26, 5, 1);

	<sect4>
	  <title>Simon</title>
	  <para>
	    Simon is a project manager for project S.1.  He works for
	    Department S (org 1050).  He authenticates using
	    plaintext.  You can connect as Simon using this query:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select *
vpd-#  from veil2.create_session('Simon', 'plaintext', 4, 1050) c
vpd-# cross join veil2.open_connection(c.session_id, 1, 'passwd7') o1;
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Simon's only assigned roles, are
	    <literal>connect</literal>, assigned in global context in
	    <literal>veil2.accessor_roles</literal>, and
	    <literal>project manager</literal> assigned in the context
	    of project 1 in
	    <literal>demo.project_assignments</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This limits what Simon can see to data about project 1,
	    and data about himself through privileges assigned in
	    personal context.  What is interesting, and cool, is that
	    Simon is able to see the <literal>demo.parties</literal>
	    record for the org that owns project 1:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select * from demo.parties;
 party_id | party_type_id | corp_id | org_id |  party_name  |   password   
----------+---------------+---------+--------+--------------+--------------

(2 rows)
vpd=> 
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    His access to the record for Department S arises from the
	    <literal>project viewer</literal> role, which has been
	    assigned the <literal>select orgs</literal> privilege.
	    This privilege allows the privilege holder to select from
	    parties that are organizations (not persons), and when
	    assigned in a lesser context (like project context)
	    promotes to apply in org scope.  Simon has the
	    <literal>project viewer</literal> role indirectly as it
	    has been assigned to the <literal>project
	    manager</literal> role.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Understanding how a user gains their privileges, and the
	    contexts in which they apply, can be tricky.  This is
	    where the developer views, and general postgres expertise
	    come in.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Let's begin by understanding what privileges could be
	    giving us access to <literal>demo.parties</literal>.  The
	    <literal>psql \d</literal> command can be used to describe
	    a relation:
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# \d demo.parties

	    Hmmm <literal>demo.parties</literal> is a view, not a
	    table.  It appears, on inspection using
	    <literal>\d+</literal>, to not have any security
	    restrictions (calls to <literal>Veil2</literal> privilege
	    testing functions) on it, so let's take a look at the
	    underlying table: <literal>demo.parties_tbl</literal>:

	    The part of interest to us, is the
	    <literal>POLICY</literal> stuff.  We see that we can be
	    given select access via privilege 21 in various scopes, or
	    27 in org scope for the party.  If we look at the
	    privileges table we can see that these privileges are
	    <literal>select parties</literal> and <literal>select
	    orgs</literal>.  Note that to view the contents of the
	    <literal>veil2.privileges</literal> table you will need to
	    connect to a more privileged user as
	    <literal>demouser</literal> has no select privilege on
	    that table.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    So, does Simon have privileges 21 and/or 27?  Let's try
	    running the privilege testing functions directly.  We can
	    see <literal>party</literal> records 1140 and 1050.  It
	    seems likely that we can see record 1140 because its our
	    record (we are being Simon at this point).  And maybe we
	    can see record 1050 because its the owner or project 1,
	    for which we have the <literal>project manager</literal>
	    role.
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select veil2.i_have_personal_priv(21, 1140);
 i_have_personal_priv 
----------------------

(1 row)

vpd=# select veil2.i_have_priv_in_scope(27, 4, 1050);
 i_have_priv_in_scope 
----------------------

(1 row)
	    </programlisting>
	    Well, that appears to explain it but it required a few
	    assumptions about which scopes might apply.  Let's try do
	    it again, without those assumptions.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    We can discover the full set of Simon's privileges by
	    selecting from <literal><link
	    linkend="entity_session_privilege">session_privileges</link></literal>.
	    However, this contains bitmaps, which are difficult to
	    read, so it is better to use the helper view
	    <literal><link
	    linkend="view_session_privileges_info">session_privileges_info</link></literal>.
	    <programlisting>
vpd=# select * from veil2.session_privileges_info;

(5 rows)
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This shows us that we have:
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		roles 10, 11, 12 and privileges 20, 25, 26 and 27 in
		project scope for project 1;
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		role 0 and privileges 0 and 20 in global scope;
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		privilege 27 in org scope for org 1050;
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		role 2 and privileges 10, 13, 21 and 26 in personal
		scope for accessor 1140 (Simon);
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		roles 13, 14, 16 (with no privileges) in org
		scope for Secured Corp.
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This tells us which privileges we have in which scopes, as
	    well as which roles we have been assigned, directly or
	    indirectly, in which contexts.  What it doesn't tell us is
	    which roles gave us which privileges, and whether roles
	    were assigned directly or indirectly.

	    We can get more detailed information about privilege

	    This gives us pretty much the whole story.  We get
	    privilege 21 in personal scope from role 2
	    (<literal>personal context</literal> assigned in personal
	    context.  And privilege 27 in org scope for org 1050, from
	    role 11, mapped from role 10 assigned to us in project
	    scope of project 1.

	<programlisting>
vpd=# create extension veil2_minimal_demo cascade;
CREATE EXTENSION
vpd=# 
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	As an alternative you can run the <literal>minimal_demo.sql</literal>
	script which can be found as described <link

	<programlisting>
marc:veil2$ psql -d vpd -f /usr/share/postgresql/12/veil2/minimal_demo.sql
	</programlisting>
	This installs the veil2_demo and runs a simple set of tests on
	it.  Note that in order to run the tests as supplied, the
	postgres user <literal>demouser</literal> must be given access
	as described below
      </para>
      <para>
	As a final option, if you have cloned the
