  <title>Identify and Define Your Scope Types</title>
  <para>
    You need to identify the types of scopes that your privileges will
    have.  It may be easier to think in terms of relational contexts
    rather than scopes.  The two things are very simliar but contexts
    are more user-facing and scopes more implementation-facing.  Ask
    yourself, in what contexts do I need to provide different access
    rights based on user's relationships?

  <para>
    (You are not, at this stage going to be creating the scopes
    themselves, just identifying and creating their types.  This is a
    necessary precursor to creating privileges.)
  </para>
  <para>
    Anywhere that you need context-based access controls, you should
    be able to find a scope.

    global and personal contexts.

    The demo sets up 3 relational scopes.  Look for "STEP 3" in the
    file <literal>demo/demo.sql</literal>.
