  <title>Create Initial Privileges</title>
  <para>
    This is a pretty simple step.  As a starting point, we should
    create data access privileges for each table and view in our
    application.  As a minimum you should provide select and modify
    privileges but we recommend the full set of select, insert, update
    and delete privileges for each.
  </para>
  <para>
    You should aim to keep the range of privilege_ids that are in use
    as small as possible.  You do not want unused ids, as this extends
    the range and will lead to larger bitmaps being needed and,
    slightly, reduced performance.  Always allocate privilege_ids
    manually (do not use a sequence), and if you need to delete some
    privileges, try to subsequently re-use the original ids.  Note
    that <literal>Veil2</literal> defines a number of its own
    privileges.  They should generally be left alone.
  </para>
  <para>
    At this point you need to make the decision for each relation
    (table or view) what the appropriate scope is for its privileges.
    You may, at this point, discover scopes that you hadn't previously
    considererd.  You can go back to the previous step if so.
  </para>
  <para>
    You may find that you are unable to determine a suitable scope for
    some relations.  If so, leave it as null.  When you test your
    system, with an unprivileged use, you will probably have no access
    to this relation, and the scope that it needs will become
    apparent.
