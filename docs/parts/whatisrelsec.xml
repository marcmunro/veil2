  <title>What Is A Relational Security System?</title>
  <para>
    A Relational Security System is one in which each assigned
    privilege has a scope, which limits the extent to which the
    privilege applies.
  </para>
  <para>
    The scope of an assigned privilege is related to a specific subset
    of data, so that each privilege assignment will give access to
    that specific data subset.  The scope may be all-encompassing or
    very specific.  It may give access to thousands of records; to
    just a few; or even to none.  And privileges may be assigned
    multiple times, in different scopes.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example, you may be given the <literal>select user
    data</literal> privilege in a scope that grants you access to
    only your user data: <emphasis>personal scope</emphasis>; or to
    only user data for users employed in your department:
    <emphasis>departmental scope</emphasis>. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Scopes may be created from almost any definable subset of your
    data.  Mostly they are based on the relationships of your users
    with their data, though they need not be.  Typically, scopes are
    defined in terms of parties and their relationships either to
    other parties, or to specific artifacts described by your
    database.  For example, a person's relationship to the company
    they work for, or their membership of a department or project team.
  </para>
  <para>
    Having scopes associated with privileges means that the
    granularity of access controls can be as coarse or as fine as the
    data demands, and it means that there is rarely the need for more
    complex access checks than "do I have privilege X in scope Y?".
  </para>
  <para>
    Instead of having privileges which imply conditional rule checks,
    such as the privilege to
    <emphasis>maintain-a-project-if-the-user-is-a-member-of-the-project-team</emphasis>,
    privileges can effectively contain their conditionality through
    their scope.
