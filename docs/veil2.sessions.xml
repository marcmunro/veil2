Records active sessions.  There should be a background task to delete
expired sessions and keep this table vacuumed.  Note that for
performance reasons we may want to disable any foreign key constraints
on this table.

Column <literal>context_type_id</literal>: This, along with the context_id column describes the context used for
authentication of this session.  This allows users to log in in
specific contexts (eg for dept a, rather than dept b), within which
role mappings may differ.  This context information allows the session
to determine which role mappings to apply.
