    <para>
      <literal>Veil2</literal> is a Postgres add-on for implementing
      relational security systems.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <link linkend="what-is-relational-security">relational
      security system</link> Is one in which access to data is
      determined, at least partly, by a userâ€™s relationships to that
      data.  Many access controls may therefore be implicit rather
      than explicit.
    </para>
    <para>
      The primary aims of a relational security system are to make the
      management of access to data a seamless, and necessary, component of
      your application, and to make its implementation as simple as
      possible and as sophisticated as needed.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>Veil2</literal> is designed to make the implementation
      of relational security systems as easy as possible.  It provides
      an extensible framework of permissions, permission checks, and
      user authentication so that you can start building a secure
      database in a matter of hours.
    </para>
    <para>
      With <literal>Veil2</literal> we secure the database itself and
      not just applications that use it.  This means that even if your
      application server is compromised, an attacker's ability to
      access data will be limited to the data for which they can steal
      access credentials.  This gives them little more access than
      the application itself would give them.
    </para>
    <para>
      The security of database applications is more usually managed by
      building the access control rules into application servers, and
      typically these access control rules offer a fairly coarse level
      of granularity.  This is often because reasoning about access
      controls at the level of functionality is difficult.  With
      relational security modelling, it can be much easier to reason
      about what sort of user needs what sort of access, and using
      <literal>Veil2</literal> the implementation of access control
      rules becomes trivial.
