<p>
    A Relational Security System is one in which access to each piece
    of data and functionality is limited according to the user's
    relationships to that data or functionality.  Access is managed by
    privileges assigned in contexts which limit the extent to
    which that privilege applies.
  </p>
<p>
    Users acquire their privileges in various ways: all users may get a
    basic set of privileges; some users may be members of teams or
    departments and their roles in those things may give them implied
    privilege assignments; and some users may be granted specific
    roles explicitly.  Even with explicit role assignments, those
    assignments may occur in different contexts giving the user access
    to greater or smaller subsets of data: you might be a given the
    manager role for a project, or for a department, or for a
    division, or company-wide.  The same privileges would apply in
    each case, but their scope would apply to larger or smaller sets
    of data.
  </p>
<p>
    Scopes may be created from almost any definable subset of your
    data.  Mostly they are based on the relationships of your users
    with their data, though they need not be.  Typically, scopes are
    defined in terms of users and their relationships to specific
    artifacts described by your database.  For example, a person's
    relationship to the company they work for, or their membership of
    a department or project team.
  </p>
<p>
    Having scopes associated with each assigned privilege means that
    the granularity of access controls can be as coarse or as fine as
    the data demands, and it means that there is rarely the need for
    more complex access checks than "do I have privilege X in scope
    Y?".
  </p>
<p>
    Instead of having privileges which imply conditional rule checks,
    such as the privilege to
    <span class="emphasis"><em>maintain-a-project-if-the-user-is-a-member-of-the-project-team</em></span>,
    privileges can effectively contain their conditionality through
    their scope.

<a name="idm33"></a>1.1. What This Means - Some Examples</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      The description above is rather abstract.  To help make it more
      concrete, here are some examples of how a relational security
      system can work.
    </p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm36"></a>1.1.1. Separate Corporate Clients</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Imagine that you provide a
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_top">
	Software As A Service</a> solution to multiple corporate
	clients. 
      </p>
<p>
	Data for each client would be stored with a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">corp
	id</span>”</span> identifying the corporate client that it belongs
	to.  Users associated with one client would only have access
	to data for that individual client.  That is, their access to
	data would depend on their relationship with the specific
	client.  If they are an employee of Corp X, they would have
	access to only Corp X data.
      </p>
<p>
	As a refinement, data within each client could be further
	segregated into data for subdivisions within the corporation's
	own organizational hierarchy.  Users associated with a single
	division might see data only for that division, while users at
	the corporate level would see data for all divisions.  No
	special application-level code is needed to do this: it is
	just a matter of assigning privileges in different contexts:
	those of the corporation (corp context), or those of the
	subdivision (which we'll call org context).
      </p>
<p>
	We can take it even further and have data that is protected at
	the level of individual projects (project context).  If you
	are a team member of a project, you would automatically get to
	access that project's data.
      </p>
<p>
	In all of these cases, your access to data is determined by
	your relationships with that data:
	</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      if you are an employee of a specific corporation, you
	      will have access to data (only) for that corporation.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      if you are an employee of a specific subdivision, your
	      access can be limited to data specific to that subdivision.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      if you are a member of a project team, you can have
	      access to data for that project.
	    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
	You can also be granted access to data, more directly through
	the assignment of roles.  But those roles will be limited to
	specific contexts.  You could be assigned the project manager
	role in the context of a single project, or in the context of
	a subdivision, and this would give you rights either to a
	single project, or to all projects for that subdivision.
      </p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm54"></a>1.1.2. Social Media</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Imagine that you run a social media site that allows users to
	post messages which can be of 3 different types:
	</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	      private;
	    </p>
<p>
	      These messages can only be seen by the poster.
	      Typically, we might label these as draft.
	    </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	      public;
	    </p>
<p>
	      Anyone can see these messages.
	    </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	      group;
	    </p>
<p>
	      Only users who are our <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">friends</span>”</span> can see these.
	    </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      </p>
<p>
	In this scheme, you have access to group postings only if you
	are a member of the poster's group of friends.  Your access to
	those posts is determined solely through your relationship, as
	a friend, to the poster so your access rights are implied
	rather than explicitly granted.
      </p>
<p>
	This is demonstrated in the <a class="link" href="ch20.html#veil_minimal_demo" title="20.2. The veil2_minimal_demo Extension">Veil2 minimal demo</a>.
