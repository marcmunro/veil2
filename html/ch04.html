<p>
    The following concepts are crucial to a full understanding of
    <code class="literal">Veil2</code>:
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">privileges</a>;</li>

<li class="listitem">

    promotion</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    This looks like a lot to understand, but you don't need to grasp
    it all at once.  Once you fully understand <a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">privileges</a> and <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scopes" title="4.3. Scopes">scopes</a>, the rest can be dealt with as the
    need arises.  Few applications will need all of the features
    provided by <code class="literal">Veil2</code>, and you can probably ignore
    the stuff you don't think you need.
  </p>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="privileges"></a>4.1. Privileges</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      Privileges are the atomic units of access control, limiting
      access to specific data or operations.  By convention, most
      privileges are named <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&lt;action&gt;
      &lt;object&gt;</code></span>”</span>.  Actions will include:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">select;</li>
<li class="listitem">insert;</li>
<li class="listitem">update;</li>
<li class="listitem">delete;</li>
<li class="listitem">execute.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      Objects will usually be the names of tables and, for
      <code class="literal">execute</code> actions, the names of specific pieces
      of functionality.  Note that <code class="literal">Veil2</code> takes no
      notice of privilege names, using only the
      <code class="literal">privilege_id</code>.  It is up to the implementation
      to ensure that each privilege is used in a manner consistent
      with its name.
    </p>
<p>
      Privileges are not assigned directly to users.  Instead they are
      assigned through <a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">roles</a>, which are
      essentially collections of privileges.
    </p>
<p>
      A typical privilege might be <code class="literal">select parties</code>
      which we could assume would allow select access to the
      <code class="literal">parties</code> table.  Note that every privilege
      in <code class="literal">Veil2</code> applies in a specific
      <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scopes" title="4.3. Scopes">scope</a>, which is based on the <a class="link" href="ch04.html#security-contexts" title="4.2. Security Contexts">context</a> of the <a class="link" href="ch04.html#assignments" title="4.5. Role Assignments">role assignment</a> of the <a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">role</a> providing that privilege.
    </p>
<p>
      A <code class="literal">Veil2</code>-based security system is likely to
      have tens or hundreds of distinct privileges.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="security-contexts"></a>4.2. Security Contexts</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      A security context (or more usually just
      <code class="literal">context</code>) is the user-facing equivalent to a
      <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scopes" title="4.3. Scopes">scope</a>.  Where scopes apply
      at the level of individual privileges, contexts apply to the user
      and the user experience.  Specifically, we talk about contexts
      as they apply to:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    role assignments;
	  </p>
<p>
	    Each role that is assigned to a user, whether implicitly
	    or explicitly, is assigned within a given context.
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    authentication;
	  </p>
<p>
	    Different users of a <code class="literal">Veil2</code>-based system
	    may authenticate using different web pages or apps.  There
	    may be completely distinct sets of users in the context of
	    different corporate clients, with usernames only having to
	    be unique within the context of each corporation.
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><a name="mapping-context"></a>
	    mapping;
	  </p>
<p>
	    As described in <a class="link" href="ch04.html#role_mapping" title="4.4.1. Contextual Role Mapping">contextual
	    role mapping</a>, your role to role mappings may be
	    different for different users.  The context that is used
	    for a given session's role mappings is known as the
	    mapping context.
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><a name="session-context"></a>
	    sessions;
	  </p>
<p>
	    It may be that although a user authenticates in the
	    context of a corporation, their session exists within the
	    context of a specific subdivision of that corporation.
	    The access rights for the user will be determined from
	    this session context.  If they are allowed to create
	    sessions in multiple contexts, their access rights may be
	    different in each one.
	  </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      In <code class="literal">Veil2</code> there is a scope for every context,
      and vice versa.
    </p>
<p>
      The distinction between scope and context may become clear
      when we consider that a role can be assigned in a context that
      has no meaning for that role's privileges.  Consider a
      <code class="literal">team-member</code> role assigned in the context of a
      specific project that contains the <code class="literal">select
      lookups</code> privilege.  This privilege allows the accessor
      select-access to lookup data which is not project-specific.
      This privilege must operate in a different scope from the
      context of its assignment, and so its operating scope will need
      to be promoted (see <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scope-promotion" title="4.6. Scope (and Context) Promotion">scope promotion</a> below).
    </p>
<p>
      It is largely because privileges may apply in different scopes
      from their role's assignment context, that contexts and scopes
      are distinct terms.  While this may seem to be semantic
      pedantry, the opportunities for confusion when discussing scopes
      and contexts are such that the distinction is useful.  The
      author has been there and resents that he will never get those
      hours back.
    </p>
<p>
      <code class="literal">Veil2</code> provides 2 built-in security 
      contexts:
    </p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="global-context"></a>4.2.1. Global Context</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	This is a non-relational context.  Privileges assigned in
	global context apply without limitation.  If you are assigned
	a role in global context, all of its privileges will apply in
	global scope.  If you have been assigned the <code class="literal">select
	customer</code> privilege (via a role) in global context, 
        you will be able to see all <code class="literal">customer</code>
	records.
      </p>
<p>
        Global Context is powerful and dangerous. It is the level of
        access control provided by <a class="link" href="ch02.html#Traditional" title="2.1. The Traditional Approach">traditional</a> security systems and
        it should be used with great care.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="personal-context"></a>4.2.2. Personal Context</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Personal context is an implied context.  Each user has an
	implicit assignment of the <code class="literal">personal context</code>
	role in this context.
      </p>
<p>
        The personal context is all about the application user, ie the
        person that is using your application. It applies to data that
        is about that person.  This would include their authentication
        credentials, contact information, etc. The purpose of the
        personal context is to give users access to their own data,
        and no-one else’s.  Each user has their own personal context.
      </p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm294"></a>4.3.1. Scopes As a Concept</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Each type of scope represents a distinct type of relationship
	between your system's users and the various relations (tables
	and views) in your database: it is these relationships that
	are the heart of relational security.
      </p>
<p>
	If your users have a relationship with an employer, then maybe
	you will want an employer scope.  If they have a relationship
	with an email domain, then you may need a domain scope.  If
	you have an organizational hierarchy that your users fit into,
	then you may need an organization or department scope.
      </p>
<p>
	Your scope types should naturally fall out from your data
	model and your access requirements.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm299"></a>4.3.2. Scopes In Practice</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	A scope describes the applicability of a <a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">privilege</a>.  Scopes are mostly
	based upon existing relationships in your data.
      </p>
<p>
	Note that for every scope, there is an equivalent <a class="link" href="ch04.html#security-contexts" title="4.2. Security Contexts">security context</a>.  Where
	contexts are user facing and are applied to the assignment of
	<a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">roles</a>, scopes apply at the level
	of individual privileges and are more of an implementation
	detail.
      </p>
<p>
	A scope may apply to an organization, a department, a project,
	or whatever you wish.  Having a privilege in the scope of one
	department would give you access rights to data for that
	department.  It would not give you access to equivalent data
	for other departments.
      </p>
<p>
	Some scopes will allow access to large subsets of data, and
	some to very small subsets.  We refer to this as the scope
	level.  A scope that is very restrictive is considered a
	low-level scope, and one that is not, is a high-level scope.
	When we talk about <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scope-promotion" title="4.6. Scope (and Context) Promotion">scope
	promotion</a>, this is always from a lower level to a
	higher level, which is to say that the scope becomes less
	restrictive, and likely to return a larger set of data.
      </p>
<p>
	A built-in scope that is particularly low-level is personal
	scope.  This limits access to data that specifically relates
	to the accessor (privilege holder).  So if <code class="literal">user
	X</code> has the <code class="literal">select user</code> privilege
	in personal scope, they will be able to see their own
	<code class="literal">users</code> record.  Whether they can see other
	<code class="literal">users</code> records will depend on whether they
	have the <code class="literal">select users</code> privilege in any
	other scopes.
      </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="roles"></a>4.4. Roles</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      Roles exist to manage collections of <a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">privileges</a>.  Because privileges
      apply at such a low level, managing access by assigning
      individual privileges is untenable.  Instead we manage groups of
      privileges through roles.  Privileges are assigned to roles, and
      roles are assigned to users.  See <a class="link" href="ch04.html#assignments" title="4.5. Role Assignments">role assignments</a>; <a class="link" href="ch04.html#security-contexts" title="4.2. Security Contexts">security contexts</a>; and <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scope-promotion" title="4.6. Scope (and Context) Promotion">scope promotion</a>, for
      information on how each privilege's <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scopes" title="4.3. Scopes">scope</a> is managed.
    </p>
<p>
      To make roles more flexible, we allow roles to be assigned to
      other roles.  We call this role-mapping.  This allows us to
      create low-level <span class="emphasis"><em>functional</em></span> roles that have
      the privileges necessary to perform a specific low-level task,
      and we assign these roles to higher-level
      <span class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span> roles which can then be assigned to
      users.  By doing this, we minimize the number of different roles
      that we need to be able to assign to users.
    </p>
<p>
      Typical functional roles might include: <code class="literal">view
      order</code>, <code class="literal">create order</code>,
      <code class="literal">approve order</code>, etc.  These function level
      roles might then be assigned to user roles such as
      <code class="literal">customer service rep</code>, <code class="literal">customer
      service manager</code>, <code class="literal">product manager</code>,
      etc.  Typically you would only assign user level roles to users.
    </p>
<p>
      As the roles themselves do not care whether they are functional
      or user level, there is no limit to how deeply role to role
      mappings may be nested.  This can be useful when you want to
      create a user-level role that combines the abilities of 2 or
      more existing user-level roles.
    </p>
<p>
      <code class="literal">Veil2</code> does not care how roles are mapped to
      each other, in fact, you can map <code class="literal">Role A</code> to
      <code class="literal">Role B</code> and then <code class="literal">Role B</code> to
      <code class="literal">Role A</code>, and <code class="literal">Veil2</code> will
      handle it just fine; it will just mean that the two roles are
      equivalent - which is hardly useful.  You may want to implement
      some policies around this for your own system.
    </p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="role_mapping"></a>4.4.1. Contextual Role Mapping</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	One of the possible use-cases for <code class="literal">Veil2</code> is
	to provide <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_database" target="_top">Virtual
	Private Databases</a> in a <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_top">SaaS</a>
	environment.  As such, it is possible that different clients
	of such a service might want different user-level roles, and
	different mappings between them and the base function-level
	roles.
      </p>
<p>
	If you don't need this, you can skip ahead.  Although
	<code class="literal">Veil2</code> provides this as a feature, you don't
	have to use it and it is not enabled by default.
      </p>
<p>
	In <code class="literal">Veil2</code>, each role to role mapping is done
	within a specific <code class="literal">mapping context</code>.  The
	default <code class="literal">mapping context</code> is global, which
	means that that role mapping applies to all users.  By
	changing this value we can make role mappings apply at
	different context levels.  Typically, we would set this to
	operate at the context of a specific SaaS client, so that
	users for each client would be able to define their own roles
	and role to role mappings.
      </p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="assignments"></a>4.5. Role Assignments</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      Users are assigned <a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">roles</a> in a
      number of ways, and <code class="literal">Veil2</code> places no limits on
      the mechanisms that an implementation may choose to use.
      Assignments may be explicit, implicit or even a combination of
      the two.
    </p>
<p>
      An explicit role assignment would consist of a record
      associating a role with the user being assigned the role, in a
      specific context (see security contexts below).  This record
      would be for the sole purpose of assigning the role.  This is
      what makes it explicit.
    </p>
<p>
      Implicit role assignments can be made in a number of ways.  In
      <code class="literal">Veil2</code> each user, by default, is assigned the
      <a class="link" href="ch21.html#personal_context_role" title="21.4.3. The Personal Context Role"><code class="literal">personal
      context</code></a> role, in their own personal context
      <a class="link" href="ch04.html#personal-context" title="4.2.2. Personal Context">as described below</a>.
      This is done by <code class="literal">Veil2</code> itself, and is not the
      result of any record relating the role to the user.  Note that
      although the role is assigned by default, it has no <a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">privileges</a>.  What <code class="literal">personal
      context</code> allows is up to your implementation.
    </p>
<p>
      Other forms of implicit role assignment will be through existing
      data relationships.  For instance, we might want project team
      members to have certain privileges to the data for their
      projects.  This would be done through their assignment to the
      project as a team member.  It is possible that such a membership
      record would have an explicit role associated with it, but it is
      equally possible that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">membership</span>”</span> is implied
      simply by the existence of a <code class="literal">team_member</code>
      record linking the user and the project.  In such a case we
      would create a <code class="literal">team member</code> role, and the
      assignment of this role to team members would be implicit.
    </p>

      Sometimes the context of a role assignment or a session is not
      entirely appropriate for all of its purposes.  In these cases,
      promotion is necessary.
    </p>
<p>
      There are 2 distinct situations where promotion occurs:

<p>
	<a class="link" href="ch04.html#privileges" title="4.1. Privileges">Privileges</a> may give access
	to rows in a table, or to specific functionality. Often, a
	privilege that is needed for a particular <a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">role</a>, will apply to an object that
	exists outside of the <a class="link" href="ch04.html#security-contexts" title="4.2. Security Contexts">context</a> of the <a class="link" href="ch04.html#assignments" title="4.5. Role Assignments">role assignment</a>.  In such cases,
	the privilege must be promoted from the context of its
	assignment to apply in a higher-level <a class="link" href="ch04.html#scopes" title="4.3. Scopes">scope</a>.
      </p>
<p>
	Consider a <a class="link" href="ch04.html#roles" title="4.4. Roles">role</a>,
	<code class="literal">CSR</code>, that has been assigned to a user in
	<code class="literal">customer context</code> for <code class="literal">customer
	Z</code>.  This hypothetical role assignment is supposed to
	give the user the ability to manage <code class="literal">customer
	Z</code> and no other customer.  Among the hypothetical
	privileges for this role are:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">select customer</code>;</li>

<li class="listitem">

<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">select lookups</code>.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
	If we assume that <code class="literal">select lookups</code> gives the

	doesn’t really apply to the <code class="literal">customer
	context</code>.  It is not related to customer-specific
	data.  In fact it should apply the same regardless of who we
	might be a <code class="literal">CSR</code> for.  This privilege should
	be applied in the global scope, but it has been assigned in
	the <code class="literal">customer context</code> for <code class="literal">customer
	Z</code>.
      </p>
<p>
	The context for the role assignment makes no sense for this
	privilege, so it must be promoted to a higher-level scope.  In
	this case, the scope would be that of the <code class="literal">global
	context</code>.
      </p>
<p>
	As another example consider that a role that has been assigned
	in <code class="literal">project context</code> provides the
	<code class="literal">select department</code> privilege to view the
	department details of the department that owns the project.
	The department details cannot be viewed in project scope,
	because projects are lower-level things: the department owns
	the project and not the other way around.  The solution is to
	promote the <code class="literal">select department</code> privilege to
	operate in department scope.  Note that if the <code class="literal">select
	project</code> privilege were promoted in the same way, it
	would allow the user to view all projects for the department.
      </p>
<p>
	The level of promotion required for each privilege is specific
	to the object that the privilege exists to protect.  So, each
	privilege identifies its target scope level.  If the privilege
	is being assigned, via a role assignment, in a lower-level
	context, then promotion to the higher target scope level will
	automatically be performed when the user's privileges are
	first loaded.

	that we use for <a class="link" href="ch04.html#role_mapping" title="4.4.1. Contextual Role Mapping">contextual role

	If the session context is not at the scope level of our target

<p>
      Each accessor (database user) is associated with a specific
      context within which they authenticate.  Typically, this context
      would represent the organization they work for.  When
      authenticating an accessor, their authentication context must be
      provided along with their username or other identifier.
    </p>
<p>
      What this means is that usernames, etc do not have to be
      globally unique, but only unique within each authentication
      context.
    </p>
<p>
      If you don't need this, you can choose to allow all accessors to
      authenticate within the same context, usually the global context.
    </p>
<p>
      As described in <a class="link" href="ch04.html#role_mapping" title="4.4.1. Contextual Role Mapping">Contextual Role
      Mapping</a> above, the role names and role to role mappings
      that an accessor sees may depend on their authentication context.
    </p>
<p>
      More information on this, with examples, can be found <a class="link" href="ch21.html#physical_authentication_context">here</a>.

<a name="session_context"></a>4.8. Session Contexts</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      When a user authenticates, they begin a session, and this session
      has a context.  The session context determines what data the
      user can see, as though the user is logged in to that context.
      Often the session context will be the same as the authentication
      context, but <code class="literal">Veil2</code> does not require this.
    </p>
<p>
      For example, consider that our authentication context is at the
      level of a corporation (so usernames must be unique within the
      entire corporation), but that we log in to the web-site for a
      subdivision.  Our authentication context would be the
      corporation context, and the session context would be the
      subdivision context.
    </p>
<p>
      The context of a user's session will determine the access rights
      for that session.  Role assignments in contexts that are
      unrelated to the session context will be ignored.
